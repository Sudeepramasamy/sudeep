      description: `The Food Supply Chain Tracker is a modern web-based application designed to revolutionize food distribution by enhancing 
      transparency, efficiency, and accessibility for both producers and consumers. The platform is built using Python, Django, React, PostgreSQL, 
      and JWT authentication, ensuring a seamless and secure experience for all users. The primary objective of this system is to address 
      inefficiencies in traditional food supply chains, which often suffer from a lack of real-time tracking, delayed distribution, and food 
      wastage due to poor stock management.This platform allows food producers, such as farmers and wholesalers, to register their products, 
      manage inventory, and share vital information about their goods. Each product is assigned a unique ID, enabling precise tracking from the 
      point of production to the hands of the consumer. By doing so, the system eliminates uncertainties regarding food origin, quality, 
      and availability, empowering consumers to make informed purchasing decisions. Additionally, farmers can share their farming techniques, 
      best practices, and tips, which helps build a community-driven approach to sustainable food production.For consumers, the Food Supply Chain 
      Tracker offers an intuitive interface where they can browse available products, check real-time stock levels, and make purchases efficiently. 
      The platformâ€™s authentication system, powered by JWT, ensures that only verified users can access and interact with the system, 
      enhancing security and trust. By integrating a planned payment system, the application aims to streamline transactions, making it easier for 
      buyers and sellers to engage in seamless trade.A key advantage of this system is its ability to reduce food waste and optimize distribution. 
      With real-time inventory tracking, producers can adjust their supply based on demand, ensuring that food reaches consumers before it spoils. 
      Moreover, the efficient logistics management provided by the platform minimizes delays, improving delivery times and overall supply chain 
      performance.In the future, the Food Supply Chain Tracker can be further expanded by incorporating AI-driven analytics to predict demand, 
      and IoT-based monitoring for real-time quality checks. By leveraging modern technology, this project has the potential to transform the 
      food supply industry into a more reliable, transparent, and efficient system, ultimately benefiting farmers, distributors, retailers, and 
      consumers alike.`,
